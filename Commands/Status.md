# git status

the command `git status` is extrenely helpful when it comes to checking in the, you guessed it, status of your repository

using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, arent being tracked, what commits need to pushed/pulled, etc. it is exactly what is sounds like, a status check

It's a command that is safe to use at any time. If you want to see what is going on it's good to use `git status` inbetween commands until you get to know the flow better

```
git add .
git status

giit commit -m "modified landing page"
git status

git push
git status
```
